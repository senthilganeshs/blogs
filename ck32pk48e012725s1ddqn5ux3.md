## Self-Balancing Binary Trees

This is in continuation with  [Functional data-structures in JAVA](https://senthilganesh.hashnode.dev/functional-data-structures-in-java-ck2o2v8ep003lkjs1by0qpsm5) where we started with following key points.

- Functional data-structures are persistent data-structures which needs to pattern match the data-types and should know the constructor to create types on the fly.
- This is in violation with object oriented programming principles such as encapsulation (pattern matching breaks encapsulation),  and polymorphism (knowing which constructor to call defeats polymorphism).

We found an alternative by having object APIs such as 
```java
Iterable<R> empty()

Iterable<T> build(final T value);
```
This helped us to overcome pattern matching the state and knowing the constructor to call while constructing functional data-structures on the fly.

Let's see a version which relies on pattern-matching and constructors and the one which uses the object API's for a quick re-cap.

```java
interface List<T> {
    class Empty<T> implements List<T>{}
    class Cons<T> implements List<T> {
        public final T head;
        public final List<T> tail;
        Cons(final T head, final List<T> tail) {
            this.head = head;
            this.tail = tail;
        }
    }
}

<T, R> R foldLeft (final List<R> list, final R seed, final BiFunction<R,T,R> fn) {
    if (list == EMPTY) return seed;
    return  foldLeft(((Cons<T>)list).tail, fn.apply(seed, ((Cons<T>)list).head), fn);
}

<T, R> List<R> map (final List<T> list, final Function<T, R> fn) {
    return foldLeft (list, new Empty<>(), (rs, t) -> new Cons<>(fn.apply(t), rs));
}
```

If we look at the above code, the map function should know the constructors "Cons" and "Empty". The implementation foldLeft does the pattern matching "list.head" and "list.tail".

And the object version which relies on object APIs for construction of types as follows:
```java
interface Iterable<T> {
    <R> Iterable<R> empty();
    Iterable<T> build (final T input);
    <R> R foldLeft (final R seed, final BiFunction<R,T,R> fn);

    deafult <R> Iterable<R> map (final Function<T, R> fn) {
        return foldLeft (empty(), (r, t) -> r.build(fn.apply(t)));
    }
}
```

If we look at the map function, it can be defined as default method in the Iterable interface itself with no knowledge of what constructor to call. That information is hidden within the implementation of the List and hence the same map function holds good for any implementation of Iterable.

In this post we will see how we can implement self-balancing binary search tree as Iterable so that we can get all the existing APIs for free without violating object oriented programming principles.

For the remainder of the post, lets see how different tree rotations are implemented using both functional and object API's.

We can understand the implementations by substituting the pattern matched variables to the  structure of the binary tree.

**Right Rotation**
```
1   []     [ 2   []         [3 [] []] ]
v   lf  rt{ rv  rtlf  rtrt {            }
```
We can perform right rotation to height balance the tree as follows:
```
 (Functional - uses pattern matching)
  NodeAVL rv (NodeAVL v lf rtlf)     rtrt
           2  [       1 []  [] ]   [3 [][] ]

(Object oriented - uses object APIs)
rt.replaceLeft(rtlf -> 
           new AVLTree<>(v, lf, rtlf));

```
Here we are replacing the left sub-tree of [2 [] [3] ] with the parent node [1].

**Left Rotation**
```
3     [  2         [1 [][]]     []  ]   []
v lf {   lv  lflf {          }   lfrt }   rt
```
We can perform left rotation to height balance the tree as follows:
```
NodeAVL lv    lflf     (NodeAVL v lfrt  rt)
         2  [1 [][]]  [           3  [] [] ]

lf.replaceRight(lfrt -> 
          new AVLTree<>(v, lfrt, rt))
```
Here we are replacing the right sub-tree of [2 [1][]] with the parent [3]

**Right Left Rotation** 
```
1   []   [ 3         [   2      []      []     ]    []  ]
v   lf   { rv  rtlf {  rtlv  rtlflf  rtlfrt   }  rtrt
```

- Swap [2] and [3] to get [1][][2[][3[][]]] which is same as Right Rotation case we have seen earlier.

```
3         [  2      []      []    ]   []
rv  rtlf  { rtlv  rtlflf  rtlfrt }  rtrt

rtlv rtlflf   { rv  rtlfrt rtrt }
2     []       { 3    []  [] }     
     
rt.swapLeft() {
     rtlf.replaceRight (rtlfrt ->
          new AVLTree<> (rv, rtlfrt, rtrt));
}
```
- Perform right rotation to get the balanced tree..

```
v   lf  rtlv  rtlflf      { rv rtlfrt rtrt }
1  []  2       []         { 3 []        [] }

NodeAVL rtlv (NodeAVL v lf rtlflf) (NodeAVL rv rtlfrt rtrt)
          2    {      1 []    [] } {         3    []    []}

rt.swapLeft().replaceLeft(rtlflf -> 
           new AVLTree<>(v, lf, rtlflf));
```
**Left Right Rotation**
```
3     [  1    []    [  2       []      []    ]
v lf  {  lv  lflf    {lfrv   lfrtlf  lfrtrt }
```

-Swap [2] and [1] to get to [3[2[1[]][]][]] which is same as Left Rotation case.

```
1   []   [   2     []        []   ]
lv  lflf  { lfrv  lfrtlf   lfrtrt }

lfrv  {lv   lflf  lfrtlf  } lfrtrt
  2   { 1    []    []     }  []

lf.swapRight() {
     lfrt.replaceLeft (lfrtlf->
         new AVLTree<> (lv,  lflf, lfrtlf));
     }
```

- Perform left rotation to get the balanced tree.

```
v     lfrv   {lv    lflf   lfrtlf }  lfrtrt     rt
3     { 2    {   1     []      []  }     [] }   []

NodeAVL lfrv (NodeAVL lv lflf lfrtlf) (NodeAVL v lfrtrt rt)
          2   [        1 []    []   ]  [       3    []  [] ]

lf.swapRight().replaceRight(lfrtrt ->
    new AVLTree<>(v, lfrtrt, rt))
```
In both these rotations we need to swap with either left or right sub-tree to get to the earlier structure which can be balanced by performing left or right rotations.

Let's now check the implementations of the replace and swap API's for the left and right sub-trees.

```java

interface BinaryTree<T extends Comparable<T>> extends Iterable<T>, Comparable<T> {
    BinaryTree<T> replaceleft (final Function<BinaryTree<T>, BinaryTree<T>> fn);
    BinaryTree<T> replaceRight (final Function<BinaryTree<T>, BinaryTree<T>> fn);
    int height();
    BinaryTree<T> swapLeft();
    BinaryTree<T> swapRight();
}

final static class AVLTree<T extends Comparable<T>> extends Iterable<T> {
    @Override 
    public BinaryTree<T> swapLeft() {
        return left.replaceRight (lfrt -> 
            new AVLTree<> (value, lfrt, right));
    }
    @Override 
    public BinaryTree<T> swapRight() {
        return right.replaceLeft (rtlf ->
           new AVLTree<> (value, left, rtlf));
    }
    @Override
     public BinaryTree<T> replaceLeft(Function<BinaryTree<T>, 
            BinaryTree<T>> left) {
          return new AVLTree<>(value, left.apply(this.left), right);
     }
    @Override
    public BinaryTree<T> replaceRight(Function<BinaryTree<T>, 
        BinaryTree<T>> right) {
         return new AVLTree<>(value, left, right.apply(this.right));
    }
    @Override
    public BinaryTree<T> build (final T input) {
        if (this.value.compareTo(other) > 0) {
            BinaryTree<T> lf = left.build(other);
            if (Math.abs(lf.height() - right.height()) == 2) { 
                 //height not balanced
                if (lf.compareTo(other) > 0) {
                     return lf.replaceRight (lfrt ->
                            new AVLTree<>(this.value, lfrt, right));
                } else {
                     return lf.swapRight()
                         .replaceRight (lfrt -> 
                              new AVLTree<> (this.value, lfrt, right));
                }
            } else {
                //height balanced after add.
                return new AVLTree<>(value, lf, right); 
            }
        } else {
             BinaryTree<T> rt = right.build(other);
             if (Math.abs (left.height(), rt.height()) == 2) {
                 if (rt.compareTo(other) < 0) {
                     return rt.replaceLeft (rtlf ->
                         new AVLTree<>(value, left, rtlf));
                 }
             } else {
                  return rt.swapLeft()
                     .replaceLeft (rtlf -> 
                         new AVLTree<> (value, left, rtlf));
             }
        }
    }
}
```
Since we have provided our build methods, we can get all the Iterable API's for free for the BinaryTree.

For Example,

```
BinaryTree.of(3,1,6,4,2,5).apply(List.of(i -> i + 1))
> [2,3,4,5,6,7]
```

We have seen in this post that whenever there is functional code which depends on pattern matching the data-type, we can identify new object API's and re-write them. The advantage we get is that we can use any implementation of BinaryTree interchangeably.
